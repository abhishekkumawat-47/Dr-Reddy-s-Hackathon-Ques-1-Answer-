## **üéØ PHASE 3: PRIORITY-WEIGHTED RANKING SYSTEM**

### **Updated Priority Hierarchy (According to Question Requirements):**
```
1. Impurity Formation (Weight: 1.0) - MOST IMPORTANT (minimization)
2. Product Yield (Weight: 0.9) - Maximize yield = more product, less waste
3. Conversion (Weight: 0.85) - Maximize substrate utilization
4. Selectivity (Weight: 0.7) - Still important for quality and downstream costs
5. Rate Constant (Weight: 0.55) - Throughput, but secondary to purity/yield
6. Temperature Sensitivity (Weight: 0.4) - Stability
7. Concentration Sensitivity (Weight: 0.4) - Robustness
8. Others (Weight: 0.2)
```

### **Why This Updated Priority Order?**

#### **1. Impurity Formation (#1 Priority - Weight: 1.0):**

- **Quality Impact**: Lower impurities = higher product purity, reduced purification costs
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Critical for pharmaceutical applications
- **Economic Impact**: Minimal impurities reduce downstream processing complexity

#### **2. Product Yield (#2 Priority - Weight: 0.9):**
- **Economic Efficiency**: Higher yield = more product per unit input, less waste
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximizes utilization of expensive starting materials
- **Sustainability**: Reduces waste generation and environmental impact
- **Profitability**: Directly impacts bottom line through improved material efficiency

#### **3. Conversion (#3 Priority - Weight: 0.85):**
- **Substrate Utilization**: Ensures maximum conversion of starting materials
- **Process Efficiency**: High conversion reduces unconverted reactant handling
- **Economic Impact**: Minimizes raw material losses

#### **4. Selectivity (#4 Priority - Weight: 0.7):**
- **Product Quality**: Still important for maintaining desired product specifications
- **Process Control**: Affects overall process efficiency and product consistency
- **Downstream Impact**: Influences purification requirements

#### **5. Rate Constant (#5 Priority - Weight: 0.55):**
- **Throughput**: Faster reactions enable higher productivity
- **Equipment Utilization**: Affects reactor sizing and residence time requirements
- **Secondary Importance**: Can be optimized after ensuring quality and yield

#### **6-7. Temperature/Concentration Sensitivity (#6-7 Priority - Weight: 0.4 each):**
- **Process Robustness**: Important for operational stability
- **Scalability**: Affects ease of scale-up and process control
- **Lower Priority**: Secondary to product quality and yield considerations

## **üìä PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE SCORING & RANKING**

### **Scoring Methodology (comprehensive_ranking.py):**

```python
def calculate_weighted_score(metrics, weights):
    score = (
        (1 - metrics['impurity_formation']) * weights['impurity_formation'] +
        metrics['yield'] * weights['yield'] +
        metrics['conversion'] * weights['conversion'] +
        metrics['selectivity'] * weights['selectivity'] +
        metrics['rate_constant'] * weights['rate_constant'] +
        (1 - metrics['temp_sensitivity']) * weights['temp_sensitivity'] +
        (1 - metrics['conc_sensitivity']) * weights['conc_sensitivity']
    )
    return normalized_score
```

### **Analysis Scope:**
- **15 Conditions**: All temperature-concentration combinations
- **Per-Condition Ranking**: Individual condition winners identified
- **Overall Performance**: Weighted average across all conditions
- **Consistency Metrics**: Performance variability assessment

## **üîç PHASE 5: ASSUMPTIONS & RATIONALE**

### **Key Assumptions Made:**

#### **1. Updated Priority Weights:**

Rationale: More robust processes are preferable for manufacturing
```

#### **3. Equal Condition Weighting:**
```
Assumption: All 15 conditions are equally important
Rationale: Process should work across entire operating window
```

#### **4. Linear Scoring:**
